Not just that I had completely forgotten what windows was all about, configs, screens, services. Anyways, I made a quick compilation of how you could run Fedora 23 and on VirtualBox running on windows 10.
Software versions
Windows: 10 VirtualBox: 5.0.16.x Fedora: 23 Sidetrack tip: Even though the installer was in English , it changed my language to Danish.</description></item></channel></rss>
