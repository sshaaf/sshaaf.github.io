A Java runtime environment should be able to run compiled source code, whereas a development kit, for example, OpenJDK, would include all the libraries/binaries to compile and run the source code.

Red Hat ships and supports container images with OpenJDK for both Java 8 and 11.</description></item></channel></rss>
