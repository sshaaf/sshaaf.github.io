More over today&amp;rsquo;s article is more about how we can use all the three selenium, ant and junit to come up with an automated solution for regressive testing.
Please refer to the documentation links above for the basic knowledge on any of the used tools.</description></item><item><title>Continous Integration - A blast from the past</title><link>https://shaaf.dev/post/2008-11-12-continous-integration-a-blast-from-the-past/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2008 20:00:16 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://shaaf.dev/post/2008-11-12-continous-integration-a-blast-from-the-past/</guid><description>Although this didn&amp;rsquo;t happen a decade ago but still has been a good case for me to learn and realize how Continuous Integration brings value addition to our work.
As I recall it was like this when they were teenagers :D Few teams working on different modules of same application, deployed together. No build process formalized No builds except for the ones that need major milestone deployments. No feedback, reports, reviews etc.</description></item><item><title>That thing about CI - Continous Integration</title><link>https://shaaf.dev/post/2008-11-12-that-thing-about-ci-continous-integration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2008 14:11:18 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://shaaf.dev/post/2008-11-12-that-thing-about-ci-continous-integration/</guid><description>Challenging Business requirements and the need for software development teams to remain agile and competitive while managing parallel development and releases requires a system which is adaptive to these demands.
Our approach to SCM enables unlimited and adaptable process models, which are ideally suited for parallel, distributed, and agile software development. Using state of the Art technologies from various vendors to automate processes such as branching, merging, build, and release keeps you a click away from software delivery.</description></item><item><title>SVN - some quick commands during merge</title><link>https://shaaf.dev/post/2008-08-25-svn-some-quick-commands-during-merge/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2008 15:55:54 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://shaaf.dev/post/2008-08-25-svn-some-quick-commands-during-merge/</guid><description>Following are some of the frequently used svn commands during merging and branching. I used to work with tortoise for this but as soon as I learned these, it feels like a more easier space to be in. Although no points taken away from tortoise, it still works pretty good for the gui part, This article is more targeted towards dark screen lovers.
Create a new branch from trunk: If you want to create a branch from a specific revision of Trunk following command is handy.</description></item><item><title>Creating an SVN wrap for your build using Ant</title><link>https://shaaf.dev/post/2008-06-30-creating-an-svn-wrap-for-your-build-using-ant/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2008 14:45:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://shaaf.dev/post/2008-06-30-creating-an-svn-wrap-for-your-build-using-ant/</guid><description>Today after along break I would jump right on to one of the interesting topics in my den these days.
One of my friends was lately troubled with doing some SVN stuff like merging etc. And a lot of people will agree with me on their first experiences. :) I think.
While Automated builds take a lot of our time I thought I could plug in with some automated merging and a few other tasks.</description></item></channel></rss>
