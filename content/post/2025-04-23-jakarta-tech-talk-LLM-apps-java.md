[Langchain4j](https://docs.langchain4j.dev/) is my favorite framework for working with large language models and [Java](https://dev.java/learn/). In the last couple of weeks, both [Bazlur](https://x.com/bazlur_rahman) and I have presented to multiple user groups and [conferences](https://shaaf.dev/conferences/). This week, we had the privilege of presenting at the Jakarta Tech Talk, which both of us were looking very much forward to. 

We now have so much demo code on the topic that we cannot present all the variations in one hour. We are still building along as we learn [here](https://github.com/learnj-ai/llm-jakarta).

Last October, I presented and was telling folks about LLMs and how to get started. Within six months, the general understanding of LLMs seems to be way much higher. I cannot explain how exciting the journey to learning LLMs has become. I am sure many feel the same way. 

Therefore, this time, we gave a 7-minute presentation, basically trying to explain what it was. Then, for the rest of the 50 minutes, we did a demo, which we hope was enjoyable for the audience.

We covered the following demos
- Prompt engineering
- Tools
- RAG
- Model Context Protocol
