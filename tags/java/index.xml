Its an amazing library that has almost everything one needs to do 2D and 3D processing and much more. Gesture recognition, face detection, Motion tracking, think of anything related to image processing and OpenCV can be your goto. Its based on the BSD license, so you can just download it and start using it.
OpenCV is written in C, and there are nice Java bindings for it too.</description></item><item><title>SQL cache stores and more in Data Grid 8.3</title><link>https://shaaf.dev/post/2022-02-24-sql-cache-stores-and-more-data-grid-83/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2022 07:07:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://shaaf.dev/post/2022-02-24-sql-cache-stores-and-more-data-grid-83/</guid><description>Orignally posted at Red Hat Developers
Red Hat Data Grid is a distributed, cloud-based datastore offering very fast response times as an in-memory database. The latest version, Data Grid 8.3, features cross-site replication with more observability and two new types of SQL cache store for scaling applications with large datasets. This version also brings improved security, support for Helm charts, and a better command-line interface (CLI).
This article is an overview of new features and enhancements in this latest version of Red Hat Data Grid.</description></item><item><title>What's new for developers in Java 18</title><link>https://shaaf.dev/post/2022-01-27-whats-new-for-developers-in-java-18/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jan 2022 07:07:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://shaaf.dev/post/2022-01-27-whats-new-for-developers-in-java-18/</guid><description>Orignally posted at Red Hat Developers
In exciting news for Java developers, Java 18 forked off from the main line at the end of last year and has entered Rampdown Phase Two. This article highlights some of the features that developers can look for in the upcoming Java 18 release, including the new simple web server module, a more sophisticated way to annotate your Javadocs, and the –finalization=disabled option, which lets you test how a Java application will behave when finalization is removed in a future release.</description></item><item><title>Deploy Quarkus everywhere with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)</title><link>https://shaaf.dev/post/2021-05-17-deploy-quarkus-everywhere/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 May 2021 07:07:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://shaaf.dev/post/2021-05-17-deploy-quarkus-everywhere/</guid><description>Orignally posted at Red Hat Developers
Java is one of the most used languages out there and has been in the top three for the last two decades. Java powers millions of applications across verticals and platforms. Linux is widely deployed in data centers, Edge networks, and Cloud. Today we announce the availability of Quarkus for all our Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) customers. If you are running RHEL, you can now also run Red Hat Build of Quarkus (RHBQ).</description></item><item><title>Creating and deploying a Java 8 runtime container image</title><link>https://shaaf.dev/post/2019-02-26-create-java-8-runtime-container-image/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Feb 2019 07:07:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://shaaf.dev/post/2019-02-26-create-java-8-runtime-container-image/</guid><description>Orignally posted at Red Hat Developers
A Java runtime environment should be able to run compiled source code, whereas a development kit, for example, OpenJDK, would include all the libraries/binaries to compile and run the source code. Essentially the latter is a superset of the runtime environment. More details on OpenJDK support and lifecycle can be found here.
Red Hat ships and supports container images with OpenJDK for both Java 8 and 11.</description></item><item><title>Getting started with JBehave in 8 steps.</title><link>https://shaaf.dev/post/2009-08-12-getting-started-with-jbehave-in-8-steps/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2009 16:13:30 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://shaaf.dev/post/2009-08-12-getting-started-with-jbehave-in-8-steps/</guid><description>This post is about JBehave and how to quickly get started with it. If you would like to know about BDD please use the following link. What is Behavioral Driven Development?
Today I have used JBehave for the first time. It does have some convincing factors for instance diving requirements into scenarios which map pretty nicely to the tests that are written with in the Steps. Thus it seems like it would be easier for Stakeholder/s to use it as a good guideline for the initial requirements.</description></item><item><title>Logging with log4J isDebugEnabled</title><link>https://shaaf.dev/post/2009-08-12-logging-with-log4j-isdebugenabled/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2009 14:39:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://shaaf.dev/post/2009-08-12-logging-with-log4j-isdebugenabled/</guid><description>Excerpt: Alot of times I have seen the questions popping up whether to use isDebugEnabled property or not.

A simple sample of use would probably be SingleInstance Desktop Application.
Lets see how that is done here.
First lets create a OneListener class that should be able to listen to ActionEvents and also be able to add Commands to itself.

And just because of that it becomes easier to change the command without chagning the caller/s. This means that you could use Command pattern when you might have the following situation
You want to parameterize objects to perform an action You want to specify, execute and queue requests at different times.
Just to quickly start you need a command object, An interface will keep it easy going in this case, thus providing you with the option of extending other classes e.</description></item><item><title>Implementing the adapter</title><link>https://shaaf.dev/post/2008-10-29-implementing-the-adapter/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2008 20:47:56 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://shaaf.dev/post/2008-10-29-implementing-the-adapter/</guid><description>Typically when implementing an interface you would have to implement all the methods that exist in that interface. A very good example is the MouseListener in the java Swing. When you need to implement more then one method where as typically you might be catching only one of them. Saying that you would also find a Mouse Adapter provided as well. Some of us use that often. And that is part of the Adapter pattern.</description></item><item><title>wasprofile -create -delete</title><link>https://shaaf.dev/post/2008-10-24-wasprofile-create-delete/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2008 13:38:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://shaaf.dev/post/2008-10-24-wasprofile-create-delete/</guid><description>Sometimes you require to do things silently, without any questions asked and &amp;ldquo;Just Do It&amp;rdquo; attitude is required.

When starting to learn a design oriented approach to applications or API, I would always recommend a factory pattern as one of the key starting notes of highlight in your design.
So today I am talking about the Abstract Factory pattern. Its not an &amp;ldquo;abstract&amp;rdquo; class or object that you call a pattern. But its a Factory of facotries and that is what exactly makes it so much wordingly abstract.</description></item><item><title>Crocus - CSV Reader</title><link>https://shaaf.dev/post/2008-10-03-crocus-csv-reader/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2008 23:38:42 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://shaaf.dev/post/2008-10-03-crocus-csv-reader/</guid><description>Easy to use ready to go CSV File Reading utility.
